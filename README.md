# SL-ticket-calculator

I wanted to see how much money i spend on my single purchase bus tickets each month but SL did not have that functionality, so i built it myself :)

The code scans through my email and collects the reciepts for my purchases, shows the sum and sorts them by month

Here is what it looks like:

The code is run with a .bat script that is scheduled to go every month but it can also be run manually :)
